\section{The initiative}
The idea for this project was derived at the course Experts in Teamwork at the 
Norwegian University of Science and Technology, with the topic ``IT management 
of modern cars''. The focus of the topic was large vehicles and trucks, and 
Kongsberg Automotive was provided as the supporting client.

\subsection{The idea}
Current news reported of an incident in China, where a stray truck wheel hit a 
man who had parked on the side of the road, and pushed him over the edge. 
Luckily he did not suffer any serious injuries from the accident. This incident 
inspired research of the frequency of this type of accidents, and whether or 
not the problem of loose truck wheels was worth solving.
